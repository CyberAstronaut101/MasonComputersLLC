This is where I am going to try and keep track of all the personal projects I've worked on.

I found that throughout my undergrad I had a lot of ideas for projects, but I never really followed through with them. I'm hoping that by putting them here, I'll be more likely to actually finish them... *hopefully*.

For more technical guide or writeups - they will be posted to the [Blog](/blog) section of this site.
