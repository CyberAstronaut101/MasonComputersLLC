MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I started my first HTML/JS class.
Since then INow that I am about to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security, the time has come to give this site a purpose.

Interested in All Things Tech. If something has electricity flowing, there is a good chance that I have experience tinkering with it.
