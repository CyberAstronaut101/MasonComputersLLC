MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I began my journey in software development. Now that I am about to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security, the time has come to give this site a purpose. 

On this site I am going to try to keep up to date notes, tutorials, and logs for the projects I am currently working on.


- The site is built using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
- The theme is based on [**Terminal**](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) by [**panr**](https://twitter.com/panr)
- The site is running on either GCP or github pages


Reach out to me via [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/Code_Master113). If you liked my site, let your friends know about MASON COMPUTERS!
