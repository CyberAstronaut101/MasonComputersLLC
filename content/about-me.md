MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I began my journey in software development. Now that I am about to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security, the time has come to give this site a purpose. 

Interested in All Things Tech. If something has electricity flowing, there is a good chance that I have experience tinkering with it. From 3D printers, a few.. or ten raspberry pi's, HAM radios, and one too many monitors in my room.   

During my extended time at home due to COVID-19, I have found myself picking up forgotten projects. On this site I am going to try to keep up to date notes, tutorials, and logs for the projects I am currently working on. 

TODO have the terminal thing here

- The site is built using [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
- The theme is based on [**Terminal**](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) by [**panr**](https://twitter.com/panr)
- The site is running on either GCP or github pages
