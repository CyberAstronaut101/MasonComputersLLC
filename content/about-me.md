MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I began my journey into computer programming. Now that I am about to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security, the time has come to give this site a purpose. 

Interested in All Things Tech. If something has electricity flowing, there is a good chance that I have experience tinkering with it.  

During my extended time at home due to COVID-19, I have found myself picking up forgotten projects. On this site I am going to try to keep up to date notes, tutorials, and logs for the projects I am currently working on.
